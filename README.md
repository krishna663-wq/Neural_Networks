# Neural_Networks

This repository contains various Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating different neural network concepts and applications. Below is a summary of each notebook included in this repository.

## Notebooks

1. **[ANN_for_Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/krishna663-wq/Neural_Networks/blob/main/ANN_for_Regression.ipynb)**:
   - This notebook demonstrates using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for regression tasks. It involves data loading, preprocessing, building, training, and evaluating the ANN model to predict continuous values such as house prices or stock prices.

2. **[Neural_Network_Lab1.ipynb](https://github.com/krishna663-wq/Neural_Networks/blob/main/Neural_Network_Lab1.ipynb)**:
   - This introductory notebook covers the basics of neural networks, including data loading, preprocessing, and building a simple neural network model. It also includes training and evaluation steps to understand the performance of the model.

3. **[Perceptron_AND_OR_XOR_Operations.ipynb](https://github.com/krishna663-wq/Neural_Networks/blob/main/Perceptron_AND_OR_XOR_Operations.ipynb)**:
   - This notebook illustrates the implementation of a perceptron to perform basic logical operations like AND, OR, and XOR. It includes the creation of the perceptron model, training, and visualizing the decision boundaries for each operation.

4. **[ANN_for_Customer_Churning_Lab4_Neural_Networks.ipynb](https://github.com/krishna663-wq/Neural_Networks/blob/main/ANN_for_Customer_Churning_Lab4_Neural_Networks.ipynb)**:
   - This notebook focuses on applying Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict customer churn. It includes data preprocessing, building an ANN model, training, and evaluating the model using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.

## Repository Structure

- Each notebook is designed to be self-contained, providing all necessary steps from data loading to model evaluation.
- The repository is primarily composed of Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to follow along and run the code interactively.
